# Hello! This is my first repository in GitHub.

# Here I am sharing my work creating simple maths functions that might be useful for anyone who is university level.

# You will find functions that will calculate the Highest Common Factor between two numbers, identify if a number is prime, and many others.
# I will keep editing and uploading more functions as I learn them as well!
